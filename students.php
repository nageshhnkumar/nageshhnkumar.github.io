             <li> All our students hail from small towns or villages, and from families faced with extreme financial challenges</li>
             <li> They are meritorious in their academics, with a minimum CGPA of 7.0, with most of them being highly driven and hungry for work and success</li>
             <li> On an average, their families have 5 members - with only the father being an earning member. In most cases, the father would either be a small farmer, or a daily wage worker, or in some other menial job</li>
             <li> Typically, the income of these families would range between a minimum of Rs 50,000/- per annum to a maximum of Rs 300,000/- per annum, with most of them under significant burden of loans</li>
             <li> Often these students are the first in their whole family lineage to have ventured into a college, and so they face a serious deficit of mentoring and guidance</li> </ul>

                <li>  Their colleges would typically be a Tier 3 college, ill equipped to make them job-ready and assist in their placements</li>
                <li>Good companies seldom hire from these colleges, and most of these colleges have either inadequate or negligible campus placements</li>
                <li>So with education loans to repay, these students face the grim prospect of finding a job for themselves after their undergraduate studies</li>
                <li>Many of them struggle for months, and often end up with jobs paying them less than Rs 10,000/- pm - thus resulting in no significant change to the pitiable financial condition of their families</li>
                <li>All in all, they face severe and extremely unfair odds against even reasonable chance of success, and quite simply need help from their more fortunate counterparts in society </li> </ul>
